# problem with latest master version of omniparser 

Everthing worked ok with omniparser commit `2045a13b` from 19.08.2022.
and test file: `CWR-TEST_001.V21`

Corresponding: 
- `schema_1.json` - parser configuration
- `result_1.json` - expected json result

But with latest changes from master branch it is parsing wrongly:
- `schema_2.json` - parser configuration aligned with new configuration names
- `result_2.json` - wrong scrambled result
